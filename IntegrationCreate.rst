Creating Networks from Other Apps
===============================================

Enrichment data stored in networks created by the GeneMANIA and STRING apps can be
used to create EnrichmentMap networks.


GeneMANIA
---------

Start by selecting a network that was created using the GeneMANIA app. Go to the 
EnrichmentMap main panel, click the menu button, and select *Create from GeneMANIA*.

STRING
------

Start by selecting a network that was created using the STRING app.

Before creating an EnrichmentMap network you must run *functional enrichment* task from the
STRING side panel. This will add the necessary enrichment data to the STRING network.
