EnrichmentMap 3.0
-----------------

EnrichmentMap 3.0 is a major release, with the following new features:

* EnrichmentMap networks can now be created from any number of enrichment data sets 
  (EnrichmentMap 2.0 supported maximum 2 data sets).
* New chart visualizations on nodes for visualizing NES scores, p-values or q-values. 
  Three new charts are available: radial heat-map, linear heat-map and heat-strips.
* New network creation dialog has the ability to scan a folder for files belonging to each dataset. 
  In most cases this removes the need to manually enter the required files.
* New control panel allows the contents and style of the network and charts to be updated 
  dynamically.
* New legend dialog.
* New streamlined HeatMap panel has the ability to summarize expression data.
* Several new commands that allow EnrichmentMap to be automated from external scripts and CyREST.
