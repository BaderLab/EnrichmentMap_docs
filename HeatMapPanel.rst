Expression Panel (Heat Map)
===========================

The Heat Map panel shows expression values for genes that are associated with selected
nodes and edges. 

.. image:: images/heatmap/heatmap1.png

You may select any number of nodes and/or edges in the network.
Selecting an edge is equivalent to selecting the two gene set nodes that are connected to the edge.

.. note:: In EnrichmentMap 2.0 there were two separate Heat Map panels for nodes and edges.
          In EnrichmentMap 3.0 they have been combined into a single panel.

1. Expression Legend

   * Click on an expression value cell in the table to show the Expression Legend. It will not be visible
     until a value is selected.
   * Shows the value range and the color gradient for the data set associated with the selected 
     expression value. Note the value range may be different for different data sets.

2. Genes

   * All

     * Shows all of the genes from all of the selected gene sets (union).
    
   * Common

     * Shows only genes that are common to all selected gene sets (intersection).

3. Expressions

   * Values

     * Shows the raw values from the expression file(s). Expression values are rounded to 
       two decimal places.

   * Row Norm

     * Row normalizes the expression values. For each value in a row of expression the mean 
       of the row is subtracted followed by division by the rowâ€™s standard deviation.

   * Log

     * Takes the log of each expression value.

4. Compress

   * -None-

     * Shows all of the expression values.

   * Median, Min, Max

     * Shows a single column for each data set where the value is the median, min or max of all the
       values.
     * If the number of expressions per gene is greater than 50 then *Compress: Median* will be 
       automatically enabled.

5. Show Values

   * When disabled only the color gradients are shown. When enabled the expression values are shown.
   * Expression values are rounded to two decimal places.

6. Gear button

   * Opens the panel options menu.


Table

.. |sort_menu| image:: images/heatmap/sort_menu.png
   :width: 200px

.. |panel_colors| image:: images/heatmap/panel_colors.png
   :width: 250px

.. |table_colors| image:: images/heatmap/table_colors.png
   :width: 550px

Click on any of the column headers to sort the table by that column.

1. Gene Column
2. Description Column
3. Sort Column

   * This column is used to sort by ranks or by hierarchical clustring.
   * Click the **Sort** button to show a menu of different ranking options.
   * |sort_menu|
   * If a dataset has a rank file then the ranks will be listed in the menu.
   * See `Panel Menu`_ below for details on how to load additional rank files.
   * Heirarchical Clustering: Genes are clustered using a heirarchical clustering algorithm based on
     their expression values, the resulting hierarchy is then used to sort the genes.

4. Expression Columns

   * Shows expression values for each experiment.
   * If there is more than one data set and each data set has common expression values then the values
     will only be shown once.
   * If there is two or more data sets and they have different expression values then all the expression
     values are shown.

     * A colored bar that runs along the top of the expression column headers can be used to differentiate
       between the data sets. The color of the bar corresponds to the color shown next to the data set
       name in the main panel.

Panel Menu
----------

.. MKTODO, the Export has changed to add more columns in 3.1, and the dialog is different.

   :align: right

* Add Rankings

  * Opens a popup dialog that allows you to load an additional rank file. See `Add Ranks Dialog`_ below
    for more details.

* Export as TXT

  * Export the expressions currently being viewed in the heat map table as a tab-separated 
    text file. The first line of the file contains the table headers.
  * If the heat map is showing the leading edge then you will be prompted
    to save just the genes that are part of the leading edge or all the genes.

* Export as PDF

  * Export the the expressions currently being viewed in the heat map table as a PDF file.
  * The visual state of the table is reflected in the PDF file. For example to show the expression values
    in the PDF file enable the *show values* option in the toolbar.

* Hierarchical Cluster - Distance Metric

  * Allows to select the distance metric used by the hierarchical cluster algorithm.

* Auto-Focus HeatMap

  * If enabled then every time a node/edge is selected the HeatMap panel will be 
    brought to the front.

.. note:: Auto-Focus HeatMap was enabled by default in EnrichmentMap 2.0. It is now disabled by
          default in EnrichmentMap 3.0.


Add Ranks Dialog
